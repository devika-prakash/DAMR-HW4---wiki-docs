"[""['bNarendra Damodardas Modi (Gujarati pronunciation: [xcbx88nxc9x99xc9xbeendrxc9x99 dxc9x91modxc9x99xc9xbexcbx88dxc9x91s xcbx88modixcbx90] (listen); born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician serving as the 14th and current Prime Minister of India since 2014."", 'He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi."
"Modi is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation."
"He is the first prime minister outside of the Indian National Congress to win two consecutive terms with a full majority and the second to complete five years in office after Atal Bihari Vajpayee.Born to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child and has said he later ran his own stall."
"He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation."
"Modi left home after finishing high-school in part due to an arranged marriage to Jashodaben Chimanlal, which he abandoned and publicly acknowledged only many decades later."
Modi travelled around India for two years and visited a number of religious centres before returning to Gujarat.
In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS.
"During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding."
"The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary."
Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patels failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj.
Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after.
His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots or otherwise criticised for its handling of it.
A Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi personally.
"His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise."
"His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the Indian lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984."
Modis administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes.
Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy; he has centralised power by abolishing the Planning Commission.
He began a high-profile sanitation campaign and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws.
He initiated a controversial demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes.
"Following his partys victory in the 2019 general election, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir."
"His administration also introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, which resulted in widespread protests across the country."
"Described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda."
"Narendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat)."
He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915 ) and Hiraben Modi (born c. 1920).
"Modis family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community, which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government.As a child, Modi helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, and said that he later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus."
"Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, with interest in theatre."
"Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and his teachers and students noted this."
"Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.When eight years old, Modi discovered the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions)."
"There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor."
"While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding members of the BJPs Gujarat unit in 1980.Also in Narendra Modis childhood, in a custom traditional to his caste, his family arranged a betrothal to a girl, Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when they were teenagers."
"Sometime thereafter, he abandoned the further marital obligations implicit in the custom, and left home, the couple going on to lead separate lives, neither marrying again, and the marriage itself remaining unmentioned in Modis public pronouncements for many decades."
"In April 2014, shortly before the national elections that swept him to power, Modi publicly affirmed that he was married and his spouse was Jashodaben; the couple has remained married, but estranged.Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details of where he went have emerged."
"In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot."
"Modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education."
"Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modis life.In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after which Modi wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati."
"Modi then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968 ."
"Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad."
"There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latters canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city."
"After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS, working under Inamdar."
"Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested; this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him."
"Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001.In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from School of Open Learning at University of Delhi, graduating with a third class."
"Five years later, in 1983, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University, graduating with a first class as an external distance learning student."
"In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India which lasted until 1977."
"During this period, known as ""The Emergency"", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned."
"Modi was appointed general secretary of the ""Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti"", an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat."
"Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned."
Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest.
"He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations."
"Modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists."
"During this period, Modi wrote a book in Gujarati, Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In The Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the Emergency."
"Among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes, as well as several other national political figures."
"In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a Sikh.Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSSs version of the history of the Emergency."
"He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985."
"In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJPs campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modis planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers."
"After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modis work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJPs Gujarat unit later in 1987.Modi rose within the party and was named a member of the BJPs National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise L. K. Advanis 1990 Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshis 1991  Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity)."
"However, he took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead establishing a school in Ahmedabad; friction with Shankersingh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat at the time, also played a part in this decision."
"Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani, and as party secretary, Modis electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly elections."
"In November of that year Modi was elected BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh."
"The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress, INC) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha elections."
"Modi, on the selection committee for the 1998 Assembly elections in Gujarat, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party."
"His strategy was credited as key to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections, and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year."
"In 2001, Keshubhai Patels health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections."
"Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patels standing had been damaged by his administrations handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001."
"The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patels administration, was chosen as a replacement."
"Although BJP leader L. K. Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modis lack of experience in government, Modi declined an offer to be Patels deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he was ""going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all""."
"On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat, with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections."
"Modi was sworn in as Chief Minister on 7 October 2001, and entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 by winning a by-election to the Rajkot   II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC by 14,728 votes."
"On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people."
The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.
"In making a public statement after the incident, Modi declared it a terrorist attack planned and orchestrated by local Muslims."
"The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh across the state."
"Riots began during the bandh, and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat."
The governments decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.
The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed.
Independent sources put the death toll at over 2000.
"Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps."
"Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women.The government of Gujarat itself is generally considered by scholars to have been complicit in the riots, and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation."
"Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom, while others have called it an example of state terrorism."
"Summarising academic views on the subject, Martha Nussbaum said: ""There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law."""
"The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets, but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating."
"The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh, despite such actions being illegal at the time."
"State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, and the camps were often unable to meet the needs of those living there."
"Muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for Muslim victims would be half of that offered to Hindus, although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court."
"During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able."
"In 2012 Maya Kodnani, a minister in Modis government from 2007 to 2009, was convicted by a lower court for participation in the Naroda Patiya massacre during the 2002 riots."
"Although Modis government had announced that it would seek the death penalty for Kodnani on appeal, it reversed its decision in 2013."
"On 21 April 2018, the Gujarat High Court acquitted Kodnani while noting that there were several shortfalls in the investigation.Modis personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated."
"During the riots, Modi said that ""What is happening is a chain of action and reaction."""
"Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode."
"In March 2008, the Supreme Court reopened several cases related to the 2002 riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue."
"In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri (widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre), in April 2009 the court also asked the SIT to investigate the issue of Modis complicity in the killings."
"The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him."
"In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court."
"Contrary to the SITs position, he said that Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence."
The Supreme Court gave the matter to the magistrates court.
"The SIT examined Ramachandrans report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed."
Zakia Jaffri filed a protest petition in response.
"In December 2013 the magistrates court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SITs finding that there was no evidence against the chief minister."
"In the aftermath of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party (allies in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue."
"Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted."
"His cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved."
"Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002."
"In the elections, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly."
"Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign, and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among the voters."
"He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 113,589 of 154,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes."
"On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term."
"Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the BJP winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly."
During Modis second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from Hindutva to Gujarats economic development.
"Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabads textile industry, and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet."
"When the BKS staged a farmers demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP."
Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modis administrative decisions.
"Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists."
"Modi wrote a foreword to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.Modis relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism."
"Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister) distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections."
After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJPs electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.Questions about Modis relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister.
"Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed under the aegis of the International Religious Freedom Act, the only person denied a US visa under this law."
The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots.
"As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK and the EU lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington.During the run-up to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism."
"In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh "" for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation"" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act."
He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings.
"In 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging."
"In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a ""spiritual experience"" for Valmiks, a sub-caste of Dalits."
"However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct."
"After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarats 1,600-kilometre (990 mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats."
"In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post, and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that years election."
"As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation."
His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state.
"He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth  b96.6 trillion were signed.The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects."
"By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them."
Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010.
"As a result, the states production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India."
The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to Gujarats agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007.
"Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful."
The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4 % of the area intended.
"Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent   the highest of any state."
"However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992  INC government was 12.9 percent."
In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal.
Several other companies followed the Tata to Gujarat.The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed.
"Modi significantly changed the states system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers."
"Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost."
"Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised, according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers."
A contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarats economic development during Modis tenure as chief minister.
"The states GDP growth rate averaged 10% during Modis tenure, a value similar to other highly industrialised states, and above that of the country as a whole."
"Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office, and scholars have stated that growth did not accelerate during Modis tenure."
"Under Modi, Gujarat topped the World Banks ""ease of doing business"" rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years."
"In 2013, Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for ""economic freedom"" by a report measuring governance, growth, citizens rights and labour and business regulation among the countrys 20 largest states."
"In the later years of Modis government, Gujarats economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism."
"Tax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states, as was land."
"Modis policies to make Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones, where labour laws were greatly weakened.Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modis tenure."
"In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education."
"Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the ""alarming"" category on the India State Hunger Index."
"A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found that Gujarat under Modi had a poor record with respect to immunisation in children.Over the decade from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states."
"It showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with respect to individual consumption declined."
"With respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below most Indian states."
"The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits, and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities."
"Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised."
In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index.
"Under Modi, the state government spent far less than the national average on education and healthcare."
"Despite the BJPs shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modis election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism."
"Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders."
During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders.
"He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra."
"His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh."
The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012.
"During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people, something he would repeat in the 2014 general election."
"In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of Sanjiv Bhatt."
"The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995)."
"In later by-elections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats held by the INC, although Modi did not campaign for its candidates."
"In 2013, the Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by Modi following protests by Indian-Americans."
"After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014."
Anandiben Patel succeeded him as the chief minister.
In September 2013 Modi was named the BJPs candidate for prime minister in the 2014 Lok Sabha election.
"Several BJP leaders expressed opposition to Modis candidature, including BJP founding member L. K. Advani, who cited concern with leaders who were ""concerned with their personal agendas""."
Modi played a dominant role in the BJPs election campaign.
"Several people who voted for the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they would have voted for another party."
The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.
The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi.
"During the campaign, Modi focused on the corruption scandals under the previous INC government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat."
"Modi projected himself as a person who could bring about ""development,"" without focus on any specific policies."
His message found support among young Indians and among middle-class citizens.
"The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modis commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism."
"Prior to the election Modis image in the media had centered around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, but during the campaign the BJP was able to shift this to a focus on Modis neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development, although Hindutva remained a significant part of its campaign."
The BJPs campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media.
"Modis campaign blitz cost approximately  b950 billion (US$700 million), and received extensive financial support from corporate donors."
"In addition to more conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media, and addressed more than 1000 rallies via hologram appearances.The BJP won 31% of the vote, and more than doubled its tally in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984."
"Voter dissatisfaction with the INC, as well as with regional parties in North India, was another reason for the success of the BJP, as was the support from the RSS."
"In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, although the 10 percent of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before."
It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims.
The magnitude of the BJPs victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties and towards the right-wing.
"Modis tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism.Modi himself was a candidate for the Lok Sabha in two constituencies: Varanasi and Vadodara."
"He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi and Madhusudan Mistry of the INC in Vadodara by 570,128 votes."
"Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, was appointed prime minister by Indias president."
"To comply with the law that an MP cannot represent more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat."
Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014.
He became the first Prime Minister born after Indias independence from the British Empire.
His first year as prime minister saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations.
Modis efforts at centralisation have been linked to an increase in the number of senior administration officials resigning their positions.
"Initially lacking a majority in the Rajya Sabha, or upper house of Indian Parliament, Modi passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power."
"The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.In December 2014 Modi abolished the Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog."
The move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister.
"The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.The Modi government launched investigations by the Intelligence Bureau against numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations in the first year of the administration."
"The investigations, on the grounds that these organisations were slowing economic growth, was criticised as a witchhunt."
International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure.
Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz.
Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government.
"This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modis style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.Modi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister; a total of 1,301 such laws had been repealed by previous governments over a span of 64 years."
"He started a monthly radio programme titled ""Mann Ki Baat"" on 3 October 2014."
"Modi also launched the Digital India programme, with the goal of ensuring that government services are available electronically, building infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boosting manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promoting digital literacy.Modi launched Ujjwala scheme to provide free LPG connection to rural households."
The scheme led to an increase in LPG consumption by 56% in 2019 as compared to 2014.
